description

Description

This recipe for Ukrainian Honey Cake or Medivnyk and other honey pastries are traditional for Christmas, New Year's and Jewish New Year or Rosh Hashanah. The scarcity of sugar in the old days inspired Ukraine bakers to experiment with honey in baked goods, to good effect. There are as many versions of medivnyk as there are families. Some are made with sour cream, some with almonds or chocolate, and some are yeast-raised. What remains constant is the use of honey, preferably buckwheat honey. Honey pastries take a few days to ripen for flavors to be at their best.

Ingredients

    ½ cup unsalted butter at room temperature
    1 cup dark brown sugar
    1 cup buckwheat honey
    4 eggs separated, divided use
    1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
    2 teaspoons baking soda
    1 teaspoon baking powder
    pinch of fine grain sea salt
    1 teaspoon cinnamon
    ½ teaspoon nutmeg
    grated rind of one orange
    1 cup full fat sour cream
    ½ cup dried currants
    1 cup chopped walnuts
    ½ cup chopped pitted dates

Instructions

    Preheat the oven to 300° F.
    Prepare a 10-inch tube pan (like an angel food cake pan) by greasing it and then lining the bottom and sides with parchment paper. Grease the paper. Set the prepared pan aside.
    Using a stand mixer or a hand mixer, cream the butter and brown sugar together in a large mixing bowl until light and fluffy, then beat in the honey.
    Beat in the egg yolks one at a time, mixing well after each addition.
    Stir in the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Mix well.
    Add the orange rind and sour cream, beating until the batter is smooth.
    Stir in the currants, walnuts, and dates.
    In a separate bowl, whip the 4 egg whites until stiff but not dry, and fold them into the batter.
    Pour the batter into the prepared pan, spreading it evenly.
    Bake the cake in the preheated 300° F oven for 75 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean. Carefully remove the cake from the outer part of the pan and let the cake cool (upright) in the tube section. When completely cool, remove the cake from the pan.
    Wrap the cake in aluminum foil and let sit at room temperature fro 2-3 days before serving. It may be eaten sooner, but the flavor won’t be as rich. Sprinkle with powdered sugar before serving if desired.
